# expApp
A simple expense reimbursement application.


The solution is basically just modeling the information from the form and saving it to an array. When it's added, I add an 'id' to the object in order to find that object in the array when using ng-option to delete and reimburse the expense.


I went with a really clean design with a few css transitions to better a better user experience. I'm not a big fan of harsh movements when using a website, so those little things make a difference in my mind. Overall I'm happy with the way it ended up looking, I would probably add a couple splashed of bright color if I were to continue working on it.

As far as improvements to the actual code, I could probably make the code a little more DRY. I would probably add a small animation for the transition from new expense to reimbursed.
